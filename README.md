This project is titled "The Ugly Truths of Beauty" and was created as a product of the Kode With Klossy x Infosys Applied DS Fundamentals Challenge. My main goal was to show and address the lack of sustainability in cosmetic and beauty products.

I used Python (pandas) and Tableau to work with my datasets and visualizations. 
For a better viewing experience of the final product, please visit: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/siya.goswami/viz/TheUglyTruthsofBeautyIstheBeautyIndustryReallysoBeautiful/Dashboard12

I used AI in my implementation of: 
- Joining two datasets
- Apply a list of palm-based derivates in my ingredients search mechanism
- Debugging and aggregation functions 

Thank you Kode With Klossy and Infosys!
